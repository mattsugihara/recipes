Makes six servings

## Ingredients
 
 - 4 &frac12; cups corn
 - 6 strips of bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
 - 1 yellow onion, diced
 - 1 medium poblano, finely chopped
 - 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped
 - 1 small celery rib, finely chopped
 - 1 15oz can of whole peeled tomatoes finely chopped, or one can diced tomatoes
 - 2 medium golden potatoes (about 1 pound), peeled and cubed
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
 - 1 small bay leaf
 - 1 cup cream
 - 2 cup milk
 - black pepper
 - Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Directions

1. In a Dutch oven, render the fat out of the bacon. Set bacon aside, and remove all but three tablespoons of bacon fat from the pot.
2. Add the onions, chili peppers and celery to the pot and cook over medium heat until softened
3. Add the corn, tomatoes, potatoes, spices, and herbs. Cook, stirring often, until the liquid boils off a bit and the pan starts to sizzle, maybe 5 minutes
4. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 35-45 minutes until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.
5. Add the milk and cream, and bring back up to serving temp
6. Serve garnished with parsley and reserved bacon.

If freezing for later, cool and freeze the mixture after step 4 (before adding the dairy). Cool and freeze. To serve, bring the mixture back up to temp in a pot over medium heat, then add cream and milk. Heat for a couple more minutes to bring up to temp, and serve.
