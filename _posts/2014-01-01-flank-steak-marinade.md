## Ingredients

For approximately 1.5-2 lbs flank steak

 - 3 tablespoons minced negi
 - 1-1.5 tablespoons shoyu
 - 2 tablespoons olive oil
 - Juice of half a lemon
 - Â¾ teaspoon thyme or Italian herbs
 - Hot sauce, like Tabasco
 - pepper

Mix marinade ingredients in small bowl. Lay flank steak in bottom of pan and spread on half of marinade.  Turn steak and spread remaining marinade on other side.  Cover pan and marinate, covered, for at least 20 mins. at room temp or refrigerate for up to a day or two.

Grill steak or cook under oven broiler, as follows:  Preheat broiler to red-hot.  Place steak on broiler pan and set pan under broiler within approx. 3 inches of heating element.  Broil for approx. 3 minutes on each side for rosy rare or a minute or two longer per side for better done.  Let steak rest for a few minutes, then slice on diagonal, across grain.

Note:  Broiling pan with holes is best, but if not available, drain marinade from steak and place meat in any metal pan (or even a cookie sheet -- but not a no-stick one -- lined with foil, turned up at edges to catch run-off).  Of course, don't broil in Pyrex or any glass pan.
