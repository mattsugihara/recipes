## Ingredients

 - 3 cups cooked rice, cooled (preferably day old)
 - 1 Tablespoons sesame oil
 - 4 rashers of bacon (between &frac14; and &frac12; pound), chopped
 - 1 onion, diced
 - 2 eggs, beaten together
 - 2 cups mixed veggies (frozen corn, carrots, and peas work great!)
 - 1 cup kimchi, coarsely chopped
 - 2 Tablespoons kimchi juice
 - Soy sauce

## Directions

**Note:** Your best bet is to mise en place this, as it goes quickly once you start cooking.
1. Heat sesame oil in a large skillet on high heat.
2. When hot, add the onions. Toss continually until translucent, but try not to let them brown. Set aside.
3. Scrambe the eggs. Set aside.
4. Cook the bacon, stirring regularly to prevent burning. This should render a bunch of fat out of the bacon. You can remove some fat, but you'll want to keep *at least* 2 Tablespoons in the pan.
5. Return everything to the pan, including the rice, veggies, kimchi, and kimchi juice. Toss to combine.
6. Remove from heat and finish with soy sauce.
