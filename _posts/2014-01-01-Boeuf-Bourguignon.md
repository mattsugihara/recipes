## Beefy ingredients

 - 6oz unsaled and unsmoked lean bacon or pork belly
 - 3lbs lean stew beef, cut into 2 to 3 inch pieces
 - 3 cups full bodied red wine, such as Mâcon, Burgundy, or Mountain Red
 - 2 cups beef buillon
 - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
 - 3 cloves mashed garlic
 - &frac12; teaspoon thyme
 - 1 bay leaf
 - salt & pepper
 - Olive oil

## Beefy directions

1. Prehead the oven to 325°f
2. Cut the bacon into 1"x&frac14;" sticks. If you can't get unsmoked, unsalted bacon/pork belly, simmer the pork in 2 quarts of water first to remove the salt/smokey flavor.
3. Fry the bacon in a heavy bottomed frying pan, rendering out the fat.
4. Reserve the bacon to a dutch oven. Add some oil to the pan if necessary, and increase the heat to medium high (just shy of smoking). Brown the beef on all sides in batches to avoid crowding the pan. Once browned, move the beef into the dutch oven.
5. Pour out the fat and add the red wine to deglaze the pan. Scrape up the bits and then add that to the dutch oven.
6. Add the beef buillon until it almost covers the beef. Stir in everything else and bring to a simmer.
7. Place the lid on the dutch oven and set in the lower third of the oven for 2&frac12; to 3 hours until the beef is fork tender.
