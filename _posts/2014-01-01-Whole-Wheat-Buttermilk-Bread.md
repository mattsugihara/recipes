Makes two loaves

##Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- &frac12; cup warm water
- &frac34; cup very hot water
- &frac14; cup honey
- 1 &frac14; cups cold buttermilk
- 4 &frac34; cups whole wheat flour
- 1 &frac12; cups all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 to 4 tablespoons unsalted, room-temperature butter, cut into 1/4 inch pieces

##Directions

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.
2. In another bowl, mix the hot water with the honey and add the cold buttermilk.
3. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour with the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and buttermilk mixtures. Combine by stirring from the center outwards, incorporating all the flour. Test the dough at this point to make sure it is moist, but not sticky. If it is too dry, add a tablespoon of warm water and if too wet, add a tablespoon of flour.
4. Knead the dough for about 20 minutes either by hand or in a stand mixer with the dough hook attached on a low speed. Add the bits of butter near the end of the kneading time. 
5. Form the dough into a ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover it and let the dough rise for 1 &frac12; hours in a warm, dry place. After it has doubled in size, check it by pressing a finger into the center of the dough about &frac12; inch deep. If the hole doesn’t fill in or the dough sighs down, it is ready to be punched down. Punch down the dough, form it into another round and let it rise once more for approximately 45 minutes.
6. Divide the dough into two (or keep whole for one large loaf) and shape it into loaves. To shape, press dough relatively flat and roll it lengthwise (as one would roll a burrito). Place loaf seam side down in a well greased loaf pan.
7. If desired, mix 1 tsp. honey with &frac12; tsp. hot water and brush onto tops of loaves. Sprinkle 1/8 cup old fashioned oats over top of each loaf. 
8. Let loaves rise in pans in a warm place for 1 hour.
9.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and bake for 1 hour in the center rack. Let cool and slice.

Here’s an alternative to the ol’ “knock the top of the loaf and listen for a hollow sound.” After loaf has been baking for about 45 minsutes, take its internal temperature. (If you go in at an angle and through the side, you can minimize the evidence that you’ve been poking holes in your bread.) Most breads are finished baking at about 190°. Breads enriched with butter, eggs, or milk are finished when the internal temperature is around 200°.
