## Ingredients
 - 4 cups (approx. 2 lb.) whole almonds
 - 2 cups (1 lb.) salted butter
 - 3 cups white sugar
 - 6 Tablespoons light corn syrup
 - 6 Tablespoons water (Helps keep toffee from separating during heating)
 - 16 oz. semisweet chocolate chips, bars or squares (Chop into 1/4-inch sized pieces if using bars or squares)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Place almonds on a cookie sheet and toast 5 to 10 minutes (or until a light golden brown), tossing occasionally. Once cool enough, chop and set aside.
2. Butter an 18x12x1" baking sheet pan/jelly roll pan and set aside. (Do not line with parchment or waxed paper.)
3. In a medium-size, heavy-bottom, high-sided saucepan, combine butter, sugar, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until butter is fully melted and sugar has dissolved. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring gently and constantly* until mixture reaches 300°F on candy thermometer. At the target temperature, a teaspoonful of syrup will separate into brittle threads when dropped into cold water.
4. Immediately remove from heat and stir in approx. 2-½ cups of the toasted, chopped, almonds, and then quickly pour mixture into prepared pan. With a heatproof spatula, spread mixture evenly in pan. Allow to cool only slightly before proceeding to step 5.
5. Sprinkle chocolate pieces evenly over top of candy and spread as chocolate melts. Immediately sprinkle with remaining almonds. Lightly press nuts down into the chocolate with a clean, heatproof rubber spatula. Let stand for about 10-20 minutes,  until cool and set. Give pan a slight twist to "pop" candy loose and, working quickly, break toffee into pieces of desired size.
6. Store in airtight container, at the cool side of room temperature or in the refrigerator.
        
*According to candy-making blogger "Sarah," even over-stirring can cause separation. Her suggestion, which seems to have worked for me: Stir constantly until mixture reaches 212°F, then stop stirring until it reaches 236°F; resume stirring until mixture reaches 290°F. Sarah was silent as to what to do between 290 and 300°F, so I just kept stirring, slowly.
