##Ingredients

- 1 &frac12; sticks very cold unsalted butter
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- &#8531; cup very cold vegetable shortening
- ~ &frac12; cup ice water

##Instructions

1. Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator.
2. Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix.
3. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas.
4. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball.
5. Cut dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refridgerate for at least 30 minutes.

Alternately, mix the flour mixture with the shortening and butter cubes by hand, then slowly add the ice water until it's the right consistency.
