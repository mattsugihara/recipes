## Directions

### Brine
1. Combine the brine in a bag. Add the parted out chicken and let sit at least six hours (overnight is great)

### Korean chili glaze
1. Combine everthing except the green onion tops in a small sauce pan
2. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom occasionally to ensure it doesn't stick

### Batter
1. Sift all powders **except salt** together.
2. Whisk in the salt to ensure it's evenly distributed

### Chicken

#### First fry
1. In a dutch oven or similar, heat fry oil to 315°f – 325°f. Heat enough oil that it will fully cover the chicken, keeping in mind the oil level will rise when the chicken is added.
2. Remove chicken from brine. Drip dry and pat down with a paper towel to remove extra moisture.
3. Measure out 4 cups (500g) of batter powder and combine with 2 2/3 cups (600g) club soda. Whisk together until mixture is smooth and lump free.
4. Dredge chicken in all purpose flour. Shake off excess, and then coat in batter.
5. Drop battered chicken into the fryer and fry until the chicken is cooked (4-6min)
6. Remove chicken from oil and rest on wire racks
7. If cooking chicken ahead of time, allow chicken to cool, then place in the fridge

#### Second fry
1. If you cooked the chicken ahead of time, pull chicken out of the fridge 1 hour before frying
2. Bring oil to 350°f
3. Bring glaze up to room temperature
4. Fry chicken a second time, 4-6 min, until internal temp reaches 160°f
5. Glaze the chicken, garnish with white sesame seeds and green onion tops
