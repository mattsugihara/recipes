## Directions

1. Finely chop chocolate and place in a medium size bowl.
2. Bring cream, milk and tea to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and let steep for 3 minutes.

4. Whisk eggs, egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl. Slowly whisk in hot cream. Strain custard mixture into a large measuring cup.
