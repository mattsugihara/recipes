##Ingredients

- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets
- Olive oil to drizzle
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- &frac14; teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- &frac12; to &frac34; hot wing sauce of choice

##Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450F degrees.
2. Place cauliflower florets into plastic bag. Drizzle olive oil over florets to barely coat.
3. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper. Close bag and toss ingredients around so all florets are coated.
4. Place on ungreased cookie sheet or baking pan and bake on middle rack for 15 minutes, turning florets once during baking. Check them at the 10 minute mark for desired tenderness. You don't want them to be soggy!
5. Remove florets from oven. Melt butter in medium glass bowl. Add hot sauce to butter. Toss cauliflower and stir to cover all florets with hot sauce.
6. Return to oven and cook for additional 5 minutes.

Serve with blue cheese dip
