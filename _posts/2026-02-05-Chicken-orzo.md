## Ingredients

- 1 chicken breast
- 2 &frac12; cup orzo
- &frac14; cup white wine
- 1 shallot, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced

- Juice of half a lemon
- &frac12; cup parmesean
- Parsley, garnish

## Directions

1. Season the chicken and in a pan over medium high heat, brown it. Set aside. Once cool, cube it. It doesn't need to be cooked thoroughly, as it will be going back in the pot.
2. Turn the heat down to medium, add the shallots and garlic, and cook until fragrant.
3. Deglaze with white wine.
4. Add chicken stock and orzo, and cook until almost done.
5. Two minutes before the orzo is done, add the chicken, parmesean, and cream to the pot
6. Once the orzo and chicken is cooked, remove from heat. Finish with lemon juice and garnish with parsley.
