## Ingredients

### Marquise

 - 1 pound bittersweet chocolate, chopped 
 - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 
 - 1 cup roughly chopped, toasted pistachios 
 - 1 cup cold heavy cream 
 - Orange Creme Anglaise to serve
 - Candied almond slivers

### Orange Creme Anglaise

 - 2 cups half-and-half 
 - 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped 
 - 1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest 
 - 6 large egg yolks 
 - 1/2 cup sugar 
 - 2 tablespoons orange-flavored liqueur 

## Directions

### Marquise

1. Line a lightly oiled 6-cup loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside. 
2. In the top of a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, combine the chocolate and butter and melt until smooth, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and fold in the pistachios. Let cool. 
3. In a bowl fitted with an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Whisk about 1/3 of the cream into the cooled chocolate, then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and chill it overnight. 
4. Unwrap the terrine, invert onto a serving platter, and shake gently to release. Remove the plastic wrap from the top and let sit at room temperature about 15 minutes to soften. Slice into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch slices and serve with the Orange Creme Anglaise on the side, and garnish with the candied almond slivers. 

### Orange Creme Anglaise

1. In a medium saucepan, bring the half-and-half, vanilla bean and vanilla seeds, and orange zest to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla bean. 
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and ribbons form, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in about 3/4 cup of the hot half-and-half, and whisk until well incorporated. Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until it forms a thick custard, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl set in an ice bath to chill quickly. Add the orange flavored liqueur and stir to combine. 
3. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours, or overnight.
