##Ingredients

- 2 lbs. brussels sprouts
- 6 pieces bacon, preferably thick cut
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp butter (optional)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

##Directions

1. Cut the bacon into strips and render over medium-low heat, maybe 30 minutes.
2. While the bacon's rendering, mince the garlic and cut the brussels sprouts in half.
3. Once the fat has rendered from your bacon, check it out and add butter if necessary. Should be enough fat in the pan to liberally coat the sprouts. 
4. Add garlic, let it get aromatic.
5. Crank up the heat to medium-high and toss in your brussels sprouts. Turn every 4 minutes until cooked.
