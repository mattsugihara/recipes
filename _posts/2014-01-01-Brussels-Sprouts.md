## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. brussels sprouts
- 6 pieces bacon, preferably thick cut
- 2 cloves garlic
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil or butter (optional)


## Directions

1. Cut the bacon into strips and render over medium heat.
2. While the bacon's rendering, mince the garlic, slice the stem end of the sprouts off and cut them in half.
3. Once the fat has rendered from your bacon, remove it from the pan.
4. Add the garlic to the pan and let it get aromatic.
5. Increase the heat to medium-high toss in the sprouts. If there's not enough fat in the pan to coat the sprouts add some butter or olive oil.
6. Let the sprouts get brown. Return the bacon to the pan, toss, and serve.
