## Ingredients
 - 1 small onion, slivered (about 4 ounces/120g)
 - &frac12; cup (120ml) homemade dashi, or the equivalent in Hondashi (see note above)
 - &frac14; cup (60ml) dry sake
 - 2 tablespoons (30ml) soy sauce
 - 1 tablespoon (12g) sugar, plus more to taste
 - &frac12; pound (225g) thinly shaved beef ribeye or chuck steak (see note above)
 - 1 teaspoon (5ml) grated fresh ginger
 - Salt

### To Serve:
 - 2 cups cooked white rice
 - 2 poached eggs (optional)
 - Sliced scallions
 - Beni-shoga (see note above)
 - Togarashi (see note above)

## Directions

1. Combine onion, dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a medium saucepan or saucier and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.

2. Add beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.

3. Divide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.
