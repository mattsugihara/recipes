## Ingredients

### Pine nut crust

Makes three. Unused dough can be frozen for future use.

 - 2 cups (10 ounces) pine nuts 1⁄3 cup sugar
 - 3 cups all-purpose flour
 - 16 tablespoons (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
 - 1 large egg
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Lemon sabayon

 - 2 large eggs, cold
 - 2 large egg yolks, cold
 - 3⁄4 cup sugar
 - 1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice
 - 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces

### Honeyed mascarpone cream

 - 1⁄2 cup heavy cream
 - 3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese 1 tablespoon honey

## Directions


### For the crust

1. Place the pine nuts in a food processor and pulse a few times. 
2. Add the sugar and flour and continue to pulse until the nuts are finely ground.
3. Place the mixture in a mixing bowl (the dough can be mixed in a mixer fitted with the paddle or by hand) and add the softened butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Incorporate all the ingredients.
4. Divide the dough into three parts. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes before using. The dough can be frozen for future use.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
6. Generously butter and flour a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom and refrigerate it while the oven preheats.
7. Remove the tart pan from the refrigerator. Use your fingertips to press the chilled dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Trim off any excess dough.
8. Bake the crust for 10 to 15 minutes, then rotate the shell and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the shell is golden brown.
9. Remove the shell from the oven and let it cool while you make the filling. There may be some cracks in the shell; they will not affect the tart.

### For the sabayon

1. Bring about 1&frac12; inchesof water to a boil in a pot that is slightly smaller than the diameter of the mixing bowl you will be using for the sabayon.
2. Meanwhile, in a large metal bowl, whisk the eggs, yolks, and sugar for about 1 minute, or until the mixture is smooth.
3. Set the bowl over the pot and, using a large whisk, whip the mixture while you turn the bowl, for even heating.
4. After about 2 minutes, when the eggs are foamy and have thickened, add the lemon juice, one-third at a time. Whisk vigorously and allow to thicken before adding each third.
5. Continue whisking vigorously, still turning the bowl, until the mixture is thickened, light in color, and the whisk leaves a trail in the bottom of the bowl. The total cooking time should be approximately 8 to 10 minutes.
6. Turn off the heat but leave the bowl over the water as you add the butter: Whisk in the butter a piece at a time. The sabayon may loosen slightly, but it will thicken and set as it cools. Pour the warm sabayon into the tart shell and place the pan on a baking sheet.
7. Preheat the broiler. While the sabayon is still warm, place
the tart under the broiler. Leaving the door open, brown the top of the sabayon, rotating the tart if necessary for even color; do not leave the oven—this will happen in a few seconds.
8. Remove the tart from the broiler and let it sit at least 1 hour before serving. Serve at room temperature or cold.

### For the mascarpone cream
1. Whip the cream until it is frothy in a bowl set over ice.
2. Add the mascarpone and honey and continue to whisk for about 2 minutes, or until the cream is thick and creamy.
3. Keep refrigerated until serving.
