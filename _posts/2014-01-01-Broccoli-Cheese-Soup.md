##Ingredients
- 6 Tbs butter, divided
- ¾ cup onion, chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and shredded
- 4-5 cups small broccoli florets
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
- ½ tsp onion powder
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- pinch of red pepper flakes
- 4 Tbs flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup half-and-half or cream
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- salt and pepper

##Directions
1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and carrots to the pan and sauté until tender, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Stir in the broccoli, chicken broth, onion salt, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.
4. As the broccoli simmers, melt the remaining butter in a medium saucepan.
5. Add the flour and cook 1-2 minutes until golden brown, whisking constantly.
6. Whisk in the milk and cream and cook until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 5-7 minutes.
7. Remove from heat, stir in the cheese until melted, and season with salt and pepper.
8. Use an immersion blender to puree most of the broccoli mixture (if desired).
9. Stir the cheese and milk mixture into the broccoli, and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through.  Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.  Serve.
