## Ingredients

- 4 ripe tomatoes
- 1 cup fresh basil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- olive oil
- 1 &frac12; Tbsp salt
- 1 tab butter
- pasta

## Directions

1. Put on your pasta water.
2. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Sprinkle salt on the tomatoes and set aside.
3. Cut your basil into ribbons. Mince 1 Tbsp and add it to the resting tomatoes.
4. Mince your garlic and toss it into a frying pan with the oil over medium heat. When the garlic becomes aromatic, grab a collander and strain your tomato water into the frying pan. Add the butter and stir until it emulsifies. Reduce until it's the consistency of half and half.
5. Strain your pasta, and dress with the tomatoes, basil, and sauce.
